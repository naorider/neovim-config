# Neovim Config by naorider

A personal Neovim configuration focused on general programming, with special emphasis on a seamless React (with TypeScript) development experience.

## ✨ Features

- **Ready for React + TypeScript:** Major LSP setup is already done. Start coding React projects with TypeScript out of the box.
- **Modern Plugin Management:** Uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for efficient plugin management and fast startup.
- **Productivity-Oriented:** Tailored for professional software development, especially for frontend and web developers.
- **Extensible & Hackable:** Easily customizable to fit your workflow.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Neovim (latest, 0.11+ recommended)
   - Linux environment

2. **Install**

   ```

3. **Start Neovim**

   The first start will install all plugins automatically via `lazy.nvim`.
